        If the duration is just a number, that will be the length in minutes. Duration can be given
        as HH:MM or HH:MM:SS. It can also be given as numbers and time units in any order. Time
        units can be abbreviated and decimal values may be used.\n
        \n
        Example valid durations: 3.5, 2:30, 1.5 hrs 10 min, 2 minutes, 1h2m7s, 4:30:27.\n
        \n
        Duration can also be given as an until-time. Start your instruction with \"until\", \"till\",
        or \"til\" and provide a clock time and the timer will go off at that time. This follows the
        same time formatting rules as the \'alarm\' command except seconds are also allowed.\n
        \n
        You can label the timer in the data field.
    </string>
    <!-- "Add text to a file" -->
    <string name="manual_note">
        You can set the note file in the command instruction or with the \'attach\' button.\n
        \n
        You can provide note text in the data field. Otherwise, the file will be opened in an editor
        as normal.
    </string>
    <!-- "Create calendar events" -->
    <string name="manual_calendar">
        The details you enter will be sent to your calendar app. You can label the event in the
        command instruction. You can also set the date and time.\n
        \n
        To do so, separate the event title with the pipe \'|\' character and provide DATE @ TIME,
        which can also be separated by the words \'at\' and \'from\'\n
        \n
        For now, date is formatted as a month name, day number, and/or year in any order. Months may
        be abbreviated. Whole years can be given, or the shorthand \'YY with the apostrophe will
        default to the current century.\n
        \n
        \'Tomorrow\' is also a valid date. In the future, more shorthands such as weekdays will be
        supported.\n
        \n
        The time can be just the start time or START-END. The words \'until\', \'till\', \'til\',
        and \'to\' can also be used to split start and end time. Times can include seconds, see the
        \'alarm\' command for format instructions.\n
        \n
        In the future, these will all be separate fields. Example command: Calendar Tennis match |
        tomorrow from 3 to 5.\n
        \n
        You can add a location or URL to your event by using their respective field-toggle buttons.
        In the future, more details such as confidentiality and repetition pattern will be
        supported.\n
        \n
        You can use /allday to make it a whole-day event, where time-of-day info is ignored. In the
        future, this will be a toggle button.
    </string>
    <!-- "Set notification reminders" -->
    <string name="manual_notify">

        \n
        To remove a snippet, use the \'remove\' subcommand.\n
        \n
        To copy and remove a snippet, use the \'pop\' subcommand.\n
        \n
