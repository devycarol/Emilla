# Emilla
A powerful, respectful assistant for Android.

## [Releases](https://github.com/devycarol/Emilla/releases)

### Why is Emilla awesome?
- You don't need a microphone, so you can use it whenever and wherever you want.
- It never cuts you off or assumes it knows better than you.
- It's based on explicit commands, not mysterious AI language processing.
- The interface helps you find what you need.
- It never connects to the internet. It *can't*, so it won't snoop on you.
- It's designed with accessibility at front of mind.
- You can turn off sound effects if they're not your thing.
