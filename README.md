# Emilla Android assistant
### [Releases](https://github.com/devycarol/Emilla/releases)

An awesome digital assistant for Android!

What's awesome about Emilla:
- It doesn't require you to use a microphone, so you can use it wherever you want.
- It never interrupts you when you're giving a commandâ€”Emilla will never assume that it knows better than you.
- It's easy to turn off sounds if they're not your thing.
- It never connects to the internet, so it's not even capable of snooping on you ;)
- Assistance is based on explicit, configurable commands rather than black-box language processing. This means your command is processed instantly, and you never have to worry about what it will actually do.
- Emilla is designed by someone passionate about software accessibility, and has many features aimed at helping with accessibility needs :)
