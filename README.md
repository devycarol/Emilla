# Emilla
A powerful, you-respecting assistant for Android.

## [Releases](https://github.com/devycarol/Emilla/releases)

### Why is Emilla awesome?
- You don't need a microphone, you can use it wherever you want.
- It never cuts you off or tries to know better than you.
- It's based on explicit commands, not mysterious AI.
- It finds what you need and gets out of the way.
- It can't connect to the internet, it won't snoop on you.
- Accessibility is a top priority.
- You can turn off sounds if they're not your thing.
