# Emilla
A powerful, user-respecting assistant application for Android.

## [Releases](https://github.com/devycarol/Emilla/releases)

### Why is Emilla awesome?
- You don't need a microphone! You can use it wherever you want.
- It never interrupts you! Emilla will never assume it knows better than you.
- You can turn off sound effects if they're not your thing.
- It never connects to the internet! It won't snoop on you ;)
- It's designed with accessibility at front of mind! 
- It uses explicit, configurable commands rather than mysterious language processing. You never have to wonder what your command will do, and it's processed instantly!
